no longer a visual stuido solution since it wont let me compile a library while its in use and if i'm going to attach at runtime might as well not bother with its cluncly configuration

and might even sidestep visual studio altegether with (RebedyBG)[https://remedybg.handmade.network/]

the idea is to have a file watcher that auto compiles on save, and when it succesfully compiles the reloads the game engine library at runtime
